# Principles of Prompt Engineering
Before we explore specific strategies, let’s first understand the basic principles of prompt engineering, summed up in the 4 S’s below. These core rules are the basis for creating effective prompts.

# Single: Always focus your prompt on a single, well-defined task or question. This clarity is crucial for eliciting accurate and useful responses from Copilot.
# Specific: Ensure that your instructions are explicit and detailed. Specificity leads to more applicable and precise code suggestions.
# Short: While being specific, keep prompts concise and to the point. This balance ensures clarity without overloading Copilot or complicating the interaction.
# Surround: Utilize descriptive filenames and keep related files open. This provides Copilot with rich context, leading to more tailored code suggestions.
